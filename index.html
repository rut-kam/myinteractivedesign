	<h5>Top Moments: Kobe Bryant drops 81 points on Raptors in 2006</h5>
	</div>
		
		
	<div id="hl2">
	<p>Kobe Bryant's 81-point game against the Raptors in 2006 is one of the best performances in NBA history.</p>
	</div>
		
		
	<div id="bodycopy">
	<p>When Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points against the New <br> York Knicks on March 2, 1962, the NBA world knew it would<br>never see anything like it again. The fact that there were no<br> television cameras to capture the event only added to the<br> legend of the performance.</p>
	
	<p>Since that game, the 70-point margin had been crossed six<br> times and just twice since 1963, but that was as far as it went.<br> It seemed David Robinson’s 71-point game in 1994 against the<br> Clippers was as high as anyone would ever reach again. </p>
	
		
	<p>That was until Kobe Bryant burned the Toronto Raptors on<br> January 22, 2006 in one of the greatest single-game<br> performances in NBA history. As the Lakers scored a 122-104<br> comeback victory at home, Bryant finished with 81 points on<br> 28-of-46 shooting, including 7-of-13 from 3-point range, and<br> 18-of-20 from the foul line. The accomplishment stunned even<br> Bryant himself.</p>
	
		
	<p>“Not even in my dreams,” Bryant said. “That was something<br> that just happened. It’s tough to explain. It’s just one of those<br> things.“It really hasn’t, like, set in for me. It’s about the `W,’ that’s<br> why I turned it on. It turned into something special. To sit here<br> and say I grasp what happened, that would be lying.”</p>
	
		
    <p>In a season Bryant led the league in scoring with 35.4 ppg, his<br> game against Toronto had even the most seasoned NBA<br> observers starstruck.</p>
	
	
	
	<p>Teammates and staff alike were asking Bryant to autograph<br> copies of the box score after the game. Lakers public address<br> announcer Lawrence Tanter was telling fans to save their ticket<br> stubs. Then-Lakers owner Jerry Buss described the game as<br> “like watching a miracle unfold.”</p>
	
		
	<p>But it was perhaps Lakers coach Phil Jackson, who’d spent<br> nearly a decade coaching Michael Jordan, that put the<br> performance in its proper perspective.</p>
	</div>
		
		
	<div id="bodycopy2">
	<p>“That was something to behold,” Jackson said. “It<br> was another level. I’ve seen some remarkable games,<br> but I’ve never seen one like that before.”</p>
	<p>This coming from the coach who nearly pulled Bryant<br> from the game with the score out of reach after he’d<br> scored 77 points — one point shy of Chamberlain’s,<br> 78-point mark set in 1961. Jackson reconsidered<br> after discussing it with Lakers assistant coach Frank<br> Hamblen who told him, “There would be a riot.”</p>
	<p>When Bryant scored his final two points on a pair of<br> free throws with 43.4 seconds remaining, the chants<br> of “M-V-P! M-V-P!” from the 18,997 fans at Staples<br> Center couldn’t have been more fitting. Bryant<br> finished the second half scoring 55 of his 81 points —<br> the second highest point total in a half in NBA history<br> behind Chamberlain’s 59-point second half in his<br> 100-point game.With his team trailing by 18 points in<br> the third quarter, Bryant simply exploded, scoring 27<br> points in the third and 28 in the fourth. He accounted<br> for all but 18 of the Lakers points in the second half<br> and single-handedly put the game away.</p>
	<p>Bryant was hitting shots from all over the court,<br> nailing contested jumper after contested jumper,<br> leaving the Raptors without answers.</p>
	<p>“We were just watching him shoot,” said Toronto<br> forward Chris Bosh. The Raptors weren’t the only<br> one’s watching. As Bryant would later note, his<br> 81-point game was the first and only professional<br> game his grandmother had ever seen him play live.</p>
	<p>She picked the right one.</p></div>
